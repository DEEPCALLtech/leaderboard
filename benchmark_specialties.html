                <div class="research-content">
                    <p>The goal of this leaderboard is to provide a private evaluation that explores various knowledge domains and reasoning methods of small LLMs in the medicine context. This research aims to understand how these models perform on clinical cases covering knowledge, action, emergency, diagnostic, disease identification, and real life situation scenarios.</p>
                    
                    <p>This work is part of a broader research effort to analyze reasoning patterns, knowledge representation, and domain-specific capabilities of language models, with potential applications in medical education and research tools development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Private Test Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>This is a private test evaluation comparing small portable LLMs (under 13B parameters) on 1400 relevant medicine questions from different specialties divided into knowledge, action, emergency, diagnostic, disease identification, and real life situation categories.</p>
                    
                    <p>Models highlighted in green performed well on vital test questions, but this does not indicate medical reliability. A question was considered "vital" when an incorrect answer from the model LLM lead to a serious life-threatening condition.</p>
                    
                    <p>Models were put "under stress" meaning they could face a clinical case of life-threatening critical situation. They were asked to take an action and provide a real definitive answer. Our dataset of Question/Answer intend to be the most relevant in terms of clinical benchmarking. Answers graded manually by Doctor Yohann Missiak MD.</p>
