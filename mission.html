                        <p>The goal of our research is to provide private evaluations that explore various knowledge domains and reasoning methods of small LLMs in the medical context.</p>
                        
                        <p>We aim to understand how these models perform on clinical cases with varying levels of difficulty, starting with foundational knowledge and expanding to more complex scenarios.</p>
                        
                        <p>This work is part of a broader research effort to analyze reasoning patterns, knowledge representation, and domain-specific capabilities of language models, with potential applications in medical education and research tools development.</p>

                    <h2>Our <span class="highlight">Approach</span></h2>
                    <p>We evaluate small portable LLMs (under 13B parameters) on relevant medicine daily practice concepts. Due to GDPR and HIPAA legislation, LOCAL small LLMs seem to be the appropriate answer to respect patients' privacy and patient-physician data use consent.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our evaluation uses a PRIVATE dataset of Questions/Answers in order to prevent data leakage and overfitting. We put models "under stress" by testing them with clinical cases of potentially life-threatening situations. Models are asked to take an action and provide a real definitive answer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our dataset of Question/Answer pairs intends to be the most relevant in terms of clinical benchmarking. All answers are graded manually by Doctor Yohann Missiak MD, specialist of Chemical Pathology, clinical laboratory Director and Professor of Master CEMP AI Healthcare, Chichester.</p>
